# Mycitrus App Interface V2

## Summary

This is the second prototype for the interface of the mycitrus app that I am working on. I have redesigned the headline area and removed the footer from the v1 version.

## Build

This app uses React Native and the Expo managed workflow created with the blank template(non-typescript).

## Final Comments and Notes

- There is no page switch capabilities in this early prototype
- All news stores are premade in JSON data files
